    "# Finding 'A Good Read' with Beautiful Soup and Llama 3 for RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "The BBC has an excellent radio programme called '[A Good Read](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006v8jn)'. It first started 1977, and there have been hundreds of episodes, each of which has several celebrities and authors recommending a book each along with the host. Many episodes (though not all, the online archive goes back to roughly the early 1990s) are hosted for free to listen to on the BBC Sounds website. I often like to listen to it, but couldn't find anywhere that the books had been recommended were listed online. Because it's been around a long time, the format of the descriptions isn't consistent and at different points in time, there have been for e.g. more books recommended than at others. I decided to have a try and using Llama locally on my Macbook Pro M2 to try and extract the information. The source code for this post is [here](http://github.com/rpep/a-good-read)"

    "The hard part now is trying to extract the books. For this, I provide a prompt to the LLM, and instruct it to extract them, giving an example of the JSON format I would like it to return, using Llama 3's 8B instruct model and the very easy to set up [ollama](https://ollama.com/) to interface with it from Python. The system prompt below went through many iterations to get something that worked reliably, as I found that often superflous fields would appear in the JSON, the titles and authors were badly formatted or missing, authors were confused with the people recommending them, or books weren't found at all. I think that the common refrain I've seen people working with LLMs say of \"it's easy to get to 80%, but getting to >95% takes much much longer\" certainly matches my experience."

       " \"QUARTET IN AUTUMN by Barbara Pym, chosen by Samantha Harvey MRS CALIBAN by Rachel Ingalls, chosen by Harriett GilbertPHARMACOPOEIA: A DUNGENESS NOTEBOOK by Derek Jarman, chosen by Darran Anderson Two award-winning writers share books they love with Harriett Gilbert. Samantha Harvey is the author of five novels, The Wilderness, All Is Song, Dear Thief ,The Western Wind and, most recently, Orbital. She is also the author of a memoir, The Shapeless Unease: A Year of Not Sleeping. Her choice of a good read is a slim novel by Barbara Pym set in 1970s London about the lives of four single people in their sixties who work in an office together. Quartet in Autumn is sharply perceptive about the ways in which we hide from one other and from ourselves. Darran Anderson is an Irish writer who lives in London. He is the author of Imaginary Cities: A Tour of Dream Cities, Nightmare Cities, and Everywhere in Between; a memoir, Inventory, about growing up during the Troubles; and the forthcoming In the Land of My Enemy. His choice, Pharmacopoeia, brings together fragments of the artist and filmmaker Derek Jarman's writing on nature, gardening and Prospect Cottage, his Victorian fisherman's hut on the shingle at Dungeness.  Harriett's choice is a fantastically strange novel by Rachel Ingalls, published in 1982. In Mrs Caliban, a grieving housewife in a loveless marriage embarks on a heady affair with a green-skinned frogman.  Produced by Mair Bosworth for BBC Audio  Show less\",\n",
